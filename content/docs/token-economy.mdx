# **Valueflow Model**

The ecosystem generates **Free Cash Flow (FCF)** from multiple products (Accelerator, Pad, Ex, Fund, Deal Desk, Events).

### **Buyback, Burn & Redistribute**
This FCF is allocated to support the token:
1.  **25% Buyback & Burn**: Permanently removing $ATTN from circulation.
2.  **25% Buyback & Redistribute**: Reallocated for staking rewards, liquidity, and initiatives.
3.  **50% Operational Reserves**: Reinvestments and equity stakeholders.

### **Proof of Burn & Rewards Dashboard**
A public dashboard will display:
*   Total $ATTN Burnt
*   Total $ATTN Redistributed
*   Total Attention Points
*   Epoch stats

This transparency allows users to track the health of the token economy.
