## **Introducing $ATTN**


### **Role in the Ecosystem**

$ATTN is the omni-utility token that powers the entire Attention Ecosystem. It acts as a unifying asset across AttentionPad, AttentionEx, Attention, Attention Accelerator, Attention Fund, and Attention Deal Desk, enabling access, participation, rewards, and long-term alignment between users, founders, and ecosystem partners.

Through staking, rewards, governance input, and integrations across ecosystem products, $ATTN becomes the primary mechanism that connects user activity with platform growth.


### **Utility Overview**

Across the ecosystem, $ATTN enables:

* **Staking:** unlock contribution tiers, higher participation limits, partner launchpad access, and enhanced ecosystem rewards.  
* **Token Sale Participation:** staked $ATTN determines contribution caps and unlocks expanded access window tiers.  
* **Rewards:** distributed weekly based on staking, engagement, liquidity, and ecosystem quests.  
* **Burning Mechanisms:** $ATTN may be bought back and burned through ecosystem Free Cash Flow.  
* **Exchange Utility:** fee reductions, premium features, and product-specific perks within AttentionEx.  
* **Governance Input:** advisory voting and sentiment-driven participation across ecosystem decisions.  
* **Liquidity Incentives:** promotional rewards for contributing liquidity to designated pools.

These utilities evolve as additional ecosystem components come online.


### **Supply & Emissions**

**Total Supply:** 5,000,000,000 $ATTN

**Chain:** BNB Smart Chain

**Emission Model:** controlled release through buybacks across staking incentives, burning community rewards, ecosystem operations, partnerships, and liquidity support.

All emissions are designed to align long-term participation with ecosystem growth and avoid unnecessary inflation. See more in the Valueflow chart section.

#### **Token Emission Curve**


## **$ATTN Utility**


### **Staking**

Staking $ATTN unlocks enhanced access across the ecosystem. Stakers benefit from:

* Increased contribution limits during token sales  
* Access to early windows  
* Attention Points rewards  
* Eligibility for certain ecosystem opportunities without external staking  
* Enhanced weight for ecosystem rewards

Staking is optional; Basic tier users can still participate in sales.


### **Rewards**

Stakers receive weekly (epoch-based) rewards in $ATTN and Attention Points for:

* Staking balances and lock periods  
* Engagement in ecosystem quests  
* Participation in reviews via the Community Intelligence Engine  
* Supporting liquidity campaigns

Reward distribution is determined by a weighted scoring model that includes stake size, duration, and multipliers.


### **Token Sale Allocations**

In token sales, a user’s maximum contribution is determined by their staking tier. Higher tiers gain:

* Larger allocation limits  
* Priority access windows  
* Enhanced flexibility in contribution models

Unstaked users participate at the Basic tier with limited caps.


### **Burning**

$ATTN may be bought back and burned using a portion of the ecosystem’s Free Cash Flow. Burning reduces the circulating supply and creates natural long-term scarcity. These burns are discretionary and occur according to operational conditions.


### **Exchange Utility**

Within AttentionEx, $ATTN may offer:

* Reduced trading fees  
* Access to premium dashboard analytics  
* Higher withdrawal or trading limits  
* Preferential pricing or liquidity incentives

Utility expands as new exchange features are deployed.


### **Governance**

Holders may participate in:

* Sentiment-based project evaluations  
* Non-binding advisory votes  
* Weighted input on platform priorities  
* Community-wide assessments for ecosystem expansions

Governance does **not** grant ownership, revenue share, or fiduciary rights.


### **Liquidity Incentives**

$ATTN rewards may be allocated to liquidity providers supporting designated pools in the ecosystem. These incentives help stabilize trading environments and deepen liquidity across AttentionEx and partner DEXs.


## **Attention Points**


### **Utility**

Attention Points are the complementary reward of the ecosystem. They are earned through staking and used to unlock additional rewards coming from the ecosystem deal flow.

Attention Points create a dynamic participation layer that complements — not replaces — $ATTN.

### **Burn Logic**

Describe logic here

Burning permanently removes points and increases the value of active participation loops.


## **Buyback, Burn & Redistribute**


### **Overview**

A portion of the ecosystem’s Free Cash Flow (FCF) is allocated to the token economy through:

* **Buyback & Burn:** removing $ATTN from circulation  
* **Buyback & Redistribute:** returning $ATTN to active participants via rewards, liquidity incentives, or promotional campaigns

This model helps align the long-term growth of the ecosystem with the health of the token economy.


### **Proof of Burn & Rewards Dashboard**

A public dashboard displays:

* Epoch tracker  
* Global Stats (Total $ATTN Burnt, Total $ATTN Resistributed, Total ATTN Points, Last Epoch Burn, Last Epoch Redistribution, and Last Epoch Attention Points)  
* Per-Epoch Breakdown of burnt vs. redistributed $ATTN  
* Wallets operations

This transparency enables users to monitor token economy decisions and understand how ecosystem activity converts into value-driven actions.


## **Valueflow Model**

![][image3]

The Valueflow Model illustrates how capital, incentives, and operational output move through the ecosystem. It shows:

* Revenue inflows from each ecosystem product  
* How FCF is allocated  
* Token sinks and reward emissions  
* How $ATTN and Attention Points circulate  
* How participants and projects interact with the system

This diagram ties together the operational, economic, and incentive layers of the ecosystem.


### **Revenue Source**

The ecosystem generates Free Cash Flow from multiple products:

* **Attention Accelerator:** token allocations from supported startups  
* **AttentionPad:** percentage-based platform fees on fundraising  
* **AttentionEx:** trading fees, premium features, and liquidity incentives  
* **Attention Fund:** management and performance-based fees  
* **Deal Desk:** fees from private rounds and investor access  
* **Battle of the Chains:** event-driven revenue and sponsorship streams

These revenues fuel the Buyback, Burn & Redistribute engine, reinforcing the internal value loop.


### **Sustainable Token Supply & Value Alignment**

The Attention Ecosystem employs a flexible, value-aligned model that directly addresses one of Web3’s most persistent issues: the conflict between equity holders and token holders.

In most ecosystems, equity investors benefit from platform growth or the sale of treasury tokens while token holders see little direct upside. The Attention Ecosystem is designed with the goal of allowing the platform’s success to translate into value for both sides, while maintaining long-term sustainability.

Free Cash Flow (FCF) generated across selected components of the ecosystem is allocated to1:

| Allocation of Free Cash Flow (FCF) | Function |
| :---- | :---- |
| **25% Buyback & Burn** | $ATTN is purchased on the open market and permanently burned, reducing the circulating supply and creating long-term scarcity |
| **25% Buyback & Redistribute** | $ATTN is bought back and strategically reallocated to support ecosystem needs such as staking rewards, liquidity provisioning, and other community initiatives |
| **50% Held for Operational Reserves and Equity Stakeholders** | Used for reinvestments and to reward equity stakeholders |
