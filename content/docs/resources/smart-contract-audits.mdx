title: Smart Contract Audits
description: ""
---

AttentionPad prioritizes user safety and project integrity across every stage of the fundraising process. To support this, all core smart contracts used by the platform undergo independent security audits performed by reputable third-party firms. These audits help ensure that the contracts governing token sales, staking, vesting, and distribution operate securely and as intended.

Below is a summary of the audits completed for AttentionPad’s core infrastructure. Full reports will be added once the final versions are published.

### **Project Token Audits**

AttentionPad requires every project launching through the platform to submit a third-party audit of their token contract or to undergo an audit coordinated through our partners. These audits typically include:

* token standard compliance  
* mint/burn logic and permissions  
* supply controls  
* blacklist/whitelist functions  
* upgradeability risks  
* ownership and admin roles

Audit reports for each individual token sale will be listed on their respective launch pages.

### **Ongoing Security Practices**

In addition to third-party audits, AttentionPad employs several internal and ecosystem-level security practices:

* Automated static analysis and linting during development  
* Deployment verification and bytecode consistency checks  
* Continuous monitoring of token supply and admin-role changes  
* Pause mechanisms for core contracts  
* Bug reporting channels for ethical researchers

These measures complement the audit process and ensure long-term resilience of the platform.

### **Upcoming Audits**

The following contracts are scheduled for auditing as part of future platform upgrades:

* AttentionPad v2 contract suite  
* Multi-chain execution integrations

This page will be updated with new reports as soon as auditing firms publish their findings.
