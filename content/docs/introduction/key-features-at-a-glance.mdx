### **Media-Led Launches**

AttentionPad is powered by the Attention media network, giving selected projects exposure across global Web3 audiences. This creates immediate visibility, stronger community engagement, and higher-quality early participation for launches.

### **Cross-Chain by Default**

Users can contribute and claim tokens across multiple chains through integrated bridging, seamless distribution contracts, and fiat on-ramps. Projects can launch on whichever network best fits their roadmap, while participants interact from the chain of their choice.

### **Partnered & Community-Led Sales**

AttentionPad supports both ecosystem-vetted launches and community-backed opportunities. Partnered sales benefit from strategic guidance and media amplification, while community-led sales leverage sentiment, feedback, and transparent evaluation through the Intelligence Engine.

### **Flexible Launch & Contribution Models**

Projects can choose among fixed-price sales, pro-rata offerings, fair launches, and INO/IGO formats. Users benefit from structured allocation rules, tier-based access, multi-chain contributions, and clear transparency around each sale model.

### **Community Intelligence Engine**

A structured evaluation system that aggregates user insights, sentiment scoring, and review metrics to inform launch decisions. This creates a community-driven filter that rewards informed participation and elevates high-quality projects.

### **Participant Protection**

AttentionPad integrates compliance checks, project verification, anti-bot measures, token-supply monitoring, and refund mechanisms when applicable. These protections aim to reduce risk, surface red flags early, and provide participants with greater confidence.

### **Full-Stack Technical Support**

From tokenomics to auditing, deployment, vesting, and post-launch monitoring, AttentionPad provides end-to-end support. Projects gain access to infrastructure, best practices, and tooling designed to streamline launch execution across chains.
