![][image3]

The Valueflow Model illustrates how capital, incentives, and operational output move through the ecosystem. It shows:

* Revenue inflows from each ecosystem product  
* How FCF is allocated  
* Token sinks and reward emissions  
* How $ATTN and Attention Points circulate  
* How participants and projects interact with the system

This diagram ties together the operational, economic, and incentive layers of the ecosystem.

### **Revenue Source**

The ecosystem generates Free Cash Flow from multiple products:

* **Attention Accelerator:** token allocations from supported startups  
* **AttentionPad:** percentage-based platform fees on fundraising  
* **AttentionEx:** trading fees, premium features, and liquidity incentives  
* **Attention Fund:** management and performance-based fees  
* **Deal Desk:** fees from private rounds and investor access  
* **Battle of the Chains:** event-driven revenue and sponsorship streams

These revenues fuel the Buyback, Burn & Redistribute engine, reinforcing the internal value loop.

### **Sustainable Token Supply & Value Alignment**

The Attention Ecosystem employs a flexible, value-aligned model that directly addresses one of Web3’s most persistent issues: the conflict between equity holders and token holders.

In most ecosystems, equity investors benefit from platform growth or the sale of treasury tokens while token holders see little direct upside. The Attention Ecosystem is designed with the goal of allowing the platform’s success to translate into value for both sides, while maintaining long-term sustainability.

Free Cash Flow (FCF) generated across selected components of the ecosystem is allocated to1:

| Allocation of Free Cash Flow (FCF) | Function |
| :---- | :---- |
| **25% Buyback & Burn** | $ATTN is purchased on the open market and permanently burned, reducing the circulating supply and creating long-term scarcity |
| **25% Buyback & Redistribute** | $ATTN is bought back and strategically reallocated to support ecosystem needs such as staking rewards, liquidity provisioning, and other community initiatives |
| **50% Held for Operational Reserves and Equity Stakeholders** | Used for reinvestments and to reward equity stakeholders |
