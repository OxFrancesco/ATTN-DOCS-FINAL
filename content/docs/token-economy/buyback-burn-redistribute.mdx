title: Buyback, Burn & Redistribute
description: ""
---

### **Overview**

A portion of the ecosystem’s Free Cash Flow (FCF) is allocated to the token economy through:

* **Buyback & Burn:** removing $ATTN from circulation  
* **Buyback & Redistribute:** returning $ATTN to active participants via rewards, liquidity incentives, or promotional campaigns

This model helps align the long-term growth of the ecosystem with the health of the token economy.

### **Proof of Burn & Rewards Dashboard**

A public dashboard displays:

* Epoch tracker  
* Global Stats (Total $ATTN Burnt, Total $ATTN Resistributed, Total ATTN Points, Last Epoch Burn, Last Epoch Redistribution, and Last Epoch Attention Points)  
* Per-Epoch Breakdown of burnt vs. redistributed $ATTN  
* Wallets operations
