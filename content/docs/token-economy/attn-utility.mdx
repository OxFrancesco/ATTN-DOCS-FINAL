### **Staking**

Staking $ATTN unlocks enhanced access across the ecosystem. Stakers benefit from:

* Increased contribution limits during token sales  
* Access to early windows  
* Attention Points rewards  
* Eligibility for certain ecosystem opportunities without external staking  
* Enhanced weight for ecosystem rewards

Staking is optional; Basic tier users can still participate in sales.

### **Rewards**

Stakers receive weekly (epoch-based) rewards in $ATTN and Attention Points for:

* Staking balances and lock periods  
* Engagement in ecosystem quests  
* Participation in reviews via the Community Intelligence Engine  
* Supporting liquidity campaigns

Reward distribution is determined by a weighted scoring model that includes stake size, duration, and multipliers.

### **Token Sale Allocations**

In token sales, a user’s maximum contribution is determined by their staking tier. Higher tiers gain:

* Larger allocation limits  
* Priority access windows  
* Enhanced flexibility in contribution models

Unstaked users participate at the Basic tier with limited caps.

### **Burning**

$ATTN may be bought back and burned using a portion of the ecosystem’s Free Cash Flow. Burning reduces the circulating supply and creates natural long-term scarcity. These burns are discretionary and occur according to operational conditions.

### **Exchange Utility**

Within AttentionEx, $ATTN may offer:

* Reduced trading fees  
* Access to premium dashboard analytics  
* Higher withdrawal or trading limits  
* Preferential pricing or liquidity incentives

Utility expands as new exchange features are deployed.

### **Governance**

Holders may participate in:

* Sentiment-based project evaluations  
* Non-binding advisory votes  
* Weighted input on platform priorities  
* Community-wide assessments for ecosystem expansions

Governance does **not** grant ownership, revenue share, or fiduciary rights.

### **Liquidity Incentives**

$ATTN rewards may be allocated to liquidity providers supporting designated pools in the ecosystem. These incentives help stabilize trading environments and deepen liquidity across AttentionEx and partner DEXs.
