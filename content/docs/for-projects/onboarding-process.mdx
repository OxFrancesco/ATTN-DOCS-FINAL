### **1\. Intake Review**

The AttentionPad team performs an initial screening focused on:

* narrative strength  
* technological feasibility  
* market fit  
* documentation quality  
* tokenomics soundness  
* regulatory considerations

Projects that pass this stage move into internal due diligence.

### **2\. Internal Due Diligence**

The core team performs a deeper review, including:

* founder background verification  
* product validation  
* smart contract audit requirements  
* liquidity planning  
* fundraising structure  
* risk flags and mitigation strategies

This is a collaborative process — teams may be asked to adjust tokenomics, documentation, or launch design.

### **3\. Community Intelligence Engine Review**

Approved projects are presented to the AttentionPad community for structured sentiment scoring.

This includes:

* reviewer quests  
* evaluation dimensions  
* risk and opportunity scoring  
* open feedback

Community insights do **not** replace internal diligence, but they inform positioning and help gauge early interest.

### **4\. Final Approval**

Projects receiving positive reviews from both the AttentionPad reviewing committee and the community undergo a final readiness check, including:

* technical completeness  
* compliance and KYC/KYB  
* smart contract preparedness  
* launch model selection  
* marketing strategy alignment

Once approved, the project enters the launch preparation phase.

### **5\. AMA and Sale Promotion**

Projects participate in:

* AMAs hosted on community channels  
* promotional content across the Attention media ecosystem  
* narrative refinement with support from our team

This stage prepares the project for visibility and user engagement ahead of the sale.

### **6\. Token Sale**

At this stage:

* sale details are published  
* participants contribute across supported chains  
* compliance checks are enforced  
* contribution limits and sale mechanics are executed via smart contracts

After the sale completes, vesting and post-launch operations begin.
