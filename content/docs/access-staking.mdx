# **Staking Overview**

Staking **$ATTN** is the key to unlocking the full power of the Attention Ecosystem. It aligns incentives between users and the platform, rewarding long-term supporters.

*   **Unlock Tiers**: Access higher allocation limits and exclusive sales.
*   **Earn Rewards**: Generate yield in $ATTN and Attention Points.
*   **Ecosystem Alignment**: Participate in governance and sentiment scoring.

# **How to Stake $ATTN**

1.  **Navigate to Staking**: Go to the Staking dashboard on AttentionPad.
2.  **Choose Amount**: Enter the amount of $ATTN you wish to stake.
3.  **Select Lockup**: Choose your lockup period. Longer lockups earn higher multipliers (Attention Points).
4.  **Confirm**: Sign the transaction in your wallet.

### **Epochs & Lockup Period**
*   Rewards are calculated based on **Epochs** (typically weekly).
*   Your "Stake Score" is a function of Amount × Time.

### **Early Unstake Penalties**
*   If you unstake before your lockup period ends, a penalty fee is applied.
*   This penalty is burned or redistributed to remaining stakers, protecting the ecosystem from mercenary capital.

# **Tier System for Token Sales**

Your Tier determines your maximum allocation and access priority.

*   **Basic Tier**: Minimal or no staking. Lower allocation caps.
*   **Pro Tier**: Moderate staking. Higher caps, earlier access.
*   **Max Tier**: Significant staking. Highest caps, VIP access, guaranteed allocations in some rounds.

*(Specific thresholds for each tier are subject to governance and ecosystem growth).*

**Attention Points** are a complementary reward layer designed to gamify engagement and reward active participation beyond just capital.
