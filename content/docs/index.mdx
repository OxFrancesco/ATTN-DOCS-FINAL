# **What Is AttentionPad?**

**AttentionPad is a next-generation, multi-chain launchpad designed to make Web3 fundraising fair, transparent, and intelligent.** It gives users access to curated token sales, advanced protection systems, and cross-chain participation tools — all powered by the Attention ecosystem.

Traditional launchpads rely on hype, insider allocations, and opaque processes. AttentionPad replaces this with verifiable protections, flexible sale formats, and a community-driven evaluation layer that improves decision-making for both users and founders.

## **Our Mission**

To create a safer, smarter, and more inclusive Web3 fundraising environment where users, founders, and communities participate with confidence, clarity, and aligned incentives.

## **Our Vision**

A world where early access is earned — not gated — and where the most promising projects rise through transparent evaluation, community intelligence, and ecosystem-driven support.

## **Why AttentionPad Matters**

AttentionPad enables teams to launch, grow, and distribute their tokens with full-stack support, while giving participants a structured, secure, and intuitive environment to discover opportunities across chains.

It is the fundraising engine of the Attention ecosystem — connecting people, capital, community, and long-term value creation.

# **The Attention Ecosystem**

Rather than acting as a standalone platform, AttentionPad is part of an integrated pipeline that connects capital, community, technical infrastructure, and media reach. This creates a continuous support loop for projects and a more informed, structured environment for participants.

### **Attention Accelerator**
The Accelerator prepares early-stage and pre-TGE teams through tokenomics refinement, documentation support, access to institutional investors, legal advisory, strategic partnerships, GTM strategy and execution, community building, growth hacking, and narrative modelling. This combination of support enables teams to mature rapidly, strengthen their fundamentals, and position themselves as credible candidates for ecosystem-wide opportunities.

### **Deal Flow Network & Strategic Partners**
A distributed network of 600+ advisors, investors, KOLs, launch/listing platforms, and ecosystem collaborators supplies a steady stream of qualified projects. This network strengthens AttentionPad’s curation layer and ensures founders have access to operational guidance and strategic counterparts.

### **Attention Fund**
The Fund supports high-potential projects with early capital, enabling them to reach critical milestones before and after launch. This creates long-term alignment between the ecosystem and the projects selected for AttentionPad.

### **Media Infrastructure**
The Attention media ecosystem gives selected projects direct access to global Web3 audiences through a network of high-impact content channels. This includes flagship shows such as **MarioXNawfal**, **The Roundtable Show**, **The Crypto Townhall**, and **Battle of the Chains** (Coming Soon), as well as AMAs and Countdown Shows. Through these media assets and their surrounding communities, projects gain visibility, user acquisition momentum, and early narrative formation around their launches.

### **Infrastructure & Distribution Pathways**
Additional ecosystem components — including liquidity preparation, post-TGE support, tooling, and exchange pathways — help projects transition smoothly beyond the launch stage. This ensures that distribution, market access, and user growth continue after AttentionPad.
