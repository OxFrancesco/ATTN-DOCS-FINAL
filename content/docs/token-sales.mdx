# **Partnered Sales vs. Community Sales**

## **Partnered Sales**
Projects sourced and vetted by the **Attention ecosystem**, partners, or collaborators (accelerator, media, founders network). These projects receive full support and due diligence from our internal teams.

## **Community Sales**
Projects selected, reviewed, or boosted by the community. These may be influenced by the **Community Intelligence Engine**, leveraging crowd-sourced sentiment and analysis.

# **Sale Models**

## **Fixed Price Sales**
*   **Overview**: Tokens are sold at a set price.
*   **Use Cases**: Standard public rounds, seed rounds opened to the community.
*   **How it works**: Participants contribute stablecoins (or ETH/BNB) to purchase tokens at the fixed rate.

## **True Price Offerings (Coming Soon)**
*   **Overview**: A dynamic pricing model that aims to find the market-clearing price.
*   **User Flow**: Users commit funds, and the final price is determined by demand.

## **Fair Launches (Coming Soon)**
*   **Market-driven pricing**: No pre-set price; the market determines the initial value.
*   **Example**: Liquidity bootstrapping pools (LBPs) or similar mechanisms.

## **IAOs (Coming Soon)**
*   Initial Airdrop Offerings or similar mechanisms involving asset distribution.

## **INOs & IGOs (Coming Soon)**
*   **INOs**: Initial NFT Offerings.
*   **IGOs**: Initial Game Offerings (assets, skins, lands).
*   **Format**: Can be fixed price or auctions.

## **Placeholder Token Sales**
*   **How placeholders work**: You purchase a "receipt" token that represents your future claim to the real token.
*   **Swap Process**: At TGE, you swap the placeholder for the actual project token 1:1 (or predetermined ratio).
*   **Recommendation**: Used when the project token contract is not yet deployed or audited at the time of sale.
