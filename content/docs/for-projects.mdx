## **Why Launch with AttentionPad?**

Launching on AttentionPad gives teams access to a complete ecosystem designed to accelerate user acquisition, strengthen project fundamentals, and ensure a secure, transparent fundraising experience.


### **Ecosystem-Backed Distribution**

Projects benefit from a multi-layer support system that includes the Accelerator, the Deal Flow network, institutional partners, and the Attention media ecosystem.


### **Flexible Launch Models**

Fixed-price sales, pro-rata offerings, fair launches, INOs/IGOs, and placeholder token sales allow teams to choose the format that best suits their tokenomics and go-to-market strategy.


### **Cross-Chain Infrastructure**

Projects can launch on the chain that best fits their ecosystem — with contributors joining from any supported chain through bridged participation and seamless multi-chain distribution.


### **Community Intelligence Layer**

Every project benefits from structured sentiment analysis, reviewer insights, and community-driven feedback, helping refine positioning and validate interest prior to launch.


### **Participant Protection**

Built-in compliance, auditing, monitoring, and anti-bot systems help create a safer environment for both founders and participants. These safeguards strengthen trust and reduce launch risk.


### **Full-Stack Technical Support**

From tokenomics refinement and contract deployment to vesting, monitoring, and post-launch technical operations, AttentionPad provides tooling and guidance across the entire lifecycle.

### **Required Documents**

To proceed with due diligence, projects must provide:

* whitepaper or litepaper  
* tokenomics and distribution model  
* cap table and allocation details  
* SAFT templates  
* founding team KYC/KYB  
* smart contract details (if already deployed)

These documents help us evaluate legitimacy, readiness, and regulatory alignment.


## **Onboarding Process**


### **1\. Intake Review**

The AttentionPad team performs an initial screening focused on:

* narrative strength  
* technological feasibility  
* market fit  
* documentation quality  
* tokenomics soundness  
* regulatory considerations

Projects that pass this stage move into internal due diligence.


### **2\. Internal Due Diligence**

The core team performs a deeper review, including:

* founder background verification  
* product validation  
* smart contract audit requirements  
* liquidity planning  
* fundraising structure  
* risk flags and mitigation strategies

This is a collaborative process — teams may be asked to adjust tokenomics, documentation, or launch design.


### **3\. Community Intelligence Engine Review**

Approved projects are presented to the AttentionPad community for structured sentiment scoring.

This includes:

* reviewer quests  
* evaluation dimensions  
* risk and opportunity scoring  
* open feedback

Community insights do **not** replace internal diligence, but they inform positioning and help gauge early interest.


### **4\. Final Approval**

Projects receiving positive reviews from both the AttentionPad reviewing committee and the community undergo a final readiness check, including:

* technical completeness  
* compliance and KYC/KYB  
* smart contract preparedness  
* launch model selection  
* marketing strategy alignment

Once approved, the project enters the launch preparation phase.


### **5\. AMA and Sale Promotion**

Projects participate in:

* AMAs hosted on community channels  
* promotional content across the Attention media ecosystem  
* narrative refinement with support from our team

This stage prepares the project for visibility and user engagement ahead of the sale.


### **6\. Token Sale**

At this stage:

* sale details are published  
* participants contribute across supported chains  
* compliance checks are enforced  
* contribution limits and sale mechanics are executed via smart contracts

After the sale completes, vesting and post-launch operations begin.


## **Pre-Launch Advisory and Marketing Support**

AttentionPad provides structured guidance to help projects prepare for a successful launch.
